## Generation prompt

Create a polished original illustration for an R package sticker, inspired by the friendly illustrative craft of tidyverse package mascots. SQUARE full-bleed illustration, NOT a hexagon, no border, NO TEXT or letters. Flat vector-like shapes, confident dark outlines, charming expressive animal character, tightly controlled vivid palette, subtle hand-drawn character, excellent clarity at 2 inches. No photorealism, no 3D, no gradients, no drop shadows. Central composition suitable for subsequent point-up regular hexagonal cropping: keep important features within the central 65% width and central 60% height; corners contain only background. Leave lower 22% fairly quiet for a package wordmark to be added later. Character is sophisticated and endearing, not generic clip art.

A small fearless storm petrel seabird, dark ink-blue plumage with warm cream face and chest accents, a lively swept wing silhouette, flying through stylized swirling turquoise wind and indigo storm clouds. One clear small golden lightning bolt behind it. Curious purposeful expression, NOT angry. The curved wings and wind suggest gathering scattered information into a coherent whole. Dark navy outlines, periwinkle-blue background, rich teal, warm cream and a sparing golden yellow accent. Main bird in upper-middle, broad clean shapes.

## Render

Run from the package root with Python and Pillow installed:

`python3 tools/hex-sticker/render.py tools/hex-sticker/artwork.png tempest man/figures/hex-sticker.png --ink '#111f51'`

## Website icons

Run `python3 tools/hex-sticker/export-favicons.py` to regenerate pkgdown icons from the high-resolution `man/figures/hex-sticker.png`. The SVG favicon embeds raster artwork; it is not a vector master.

## Font portability and checks

The approved lettering uses Avenir Next Bold, face 0 of the macOS font collection. On another system pass `--font /path/to/bold-font.ttf`; for TTC collections also pass `--font-index N`. A supplied font can change the lettering, so inspect the output before replacing the approved artwork. Requires Python 3.8+ and Pillow 9.1+.

After exporting, run `python3 tools/hex-sticker/test-assets.py` to check icon sizes, transparency, and high-resolution output. Apple touch icons use an opaque cream background.
